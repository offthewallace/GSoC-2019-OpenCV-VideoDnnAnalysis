# GSoC-2019-OpenCV-VideoDnnAnalysis
Its for demo of GSoC-2019-OpenCV-VideoDnnAnalysis proposal 

Update 4/12: change to the abstract class model, will be done around 6 pm EST. I will try the Decorator pattern instead of the abs factory 

Update 4/13: looks like the read model would from standard function readframe but the network's output would be different. So the thing i need to do is to create a dictionary or config file for the network's output, along with the standard label and config. I will change it from the Yaml file from the OpenCV Zoo.
